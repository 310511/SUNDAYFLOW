# Step-by-Step Guide: Testing n8n and ElevenLabs Chatbots Locally

This guide will help you test the newly configured n8n and ElevenLabs chatbots on your local development environment.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

---

## Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project root:

```bash
cd "SUNDAYFLOW-main"
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

If this is your first time running the project, or if dependencies have changed, install them:

```bash
npm install
```

**Or if you're using yarn:**
```bash
yarn install
```

**Expected output:** All packages should install successfully without errors.

---

## Step 3: Start the Development Server

Run the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:8083/
  âžœ  Network: http://[::]:8083/
  âžœ  press h to show help
```

The server should start on **port 8083** (as configured in `vite.config.ts`).

---

## Step 4: Open the Application in Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8083
```

You should see your application homepage loading.

---

## Step 5: Verify Chatbots Are Loaded

### Check Browser Console

1. **Open Developer Tools:**
   - Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - Or right-click â†’ "Inspect"

2. **Check the Console Tab:**
   - Look for any errors (red text)
   - You should see: `"ElevenLabs script loaded successfully"` if ElevenLabs loaded correctly
   - Check for any 404 errors related to scripts or API calls

3. **Check the Network Tab:**
   - Click on the "Network" tab
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Look for these requests:
     - `embed.js` from `cdn.n8nchatui.com` (n8n chatbot)
     - `convai-widget-embed` from `unpkg.com` (ElevenLabs chatbot)

---

## Step 6: Test the n8n Chatbot

The n8n chatbot appears as an **animated avatar/bubble** (usually in the bottom-right corner).

1. **Locate the Chatbot Button:**
   - Look for an animated avatar/chat bubble icon
   - It should be styled with your custom colors (#23665a)

2. **Click to Open:**
   - Click on the chatbot button/avatar
   - A chat window should open

3. **Verify n8n Integration:**
   - Check the browser console (F12)
   - Look for network requests to: `https://n8n.srv982383.hstgr.cloud/webhook/27dc8f3f-135a-46ed-9a6f-149c8b9eb778/chat`
   - Send a test message (e.g., "What kind of hotels can use HotelRBS?")
   - You should receive a response from your n8n workflow

4. **Verify Customization:**
   - Title should show: "HotelRBS AI Assistance"
   - Welcome message: "Welcome to HotelRBS! ðŸ˜Š"
   - Button colors should match your theme (#23665a, #178070)

---

## Step 7: Test the ElevenLabs Voice Chatbot

The ElevenLabs chatbot is a **voice assistant** that should appear automatically (or may need to be triggered depending on configuration).

1. **Look for ElevenLabs Widget:**
   - The widget may appear as a voice button/icon
   - Usually positioned somewhere on the page (check top-right or bottom-right)
   - Look for an agent ID: `agent_7601k8adqn77ec9bhk69g39k19fp`

2. **Verify Script Loading:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check for: `"ElevenLabs script loaded successfully"`
   - Verify the custom element exists:
     ```javascript
     // In console, run:
     document.querySelector('elevenlabs-convai')
     ```
     Should return the element (not null)

3. **Test Voice Interaction:**
   - Click the ElevenLabs widget button
   - Grant microphone permissions when prompted
   - Try speaking to the agent
   - Verify the agent responds with voice

4. **Check Agent ID:**
   - Inspect the element:
     ```javascript
     // In console:
     document.querySelector('elevenlabs-convai')?.getAttribute('agent-id')
     ```
     Should return: `"agent_7601k8adqn77ec9bhk69g39k19fp"`

## Step 8: Verify Both Chatbots Work Simultaneously

1. **Test Both at Once:**
   - Open the n8n text chatbot
   - Keep ElevenLabs voice chatbot available
   - Both should work independently without conflicts

2. **Check for Errors:**
   - Monitor the browser console for any JavaScript errors
   - Check the Network tab for failed requests
   - Verify no conflicts between the two chatbot scripts

---

## Step 9: Test on Different Pages

Navigate to different pages in your application and verify:

1. **Homepage** (`/`)
2. **Search Results** (`/search`)
3. **Hotel Details** (`/hotel/:id`)
4. **Any other pages**

Both chatbots should be available on all pages where the `ChatBot` component is rendered.

---

## Step 10: Test Responsive Behavior

Test on different screen sizes:

1. **Desktop:** Full browser window
2. **Tablet:** Resize to ~768px width
3. **Mobile:** Resize to ~375px width (or use browser DevTools device emulation)

Verify:
- Chatbots are visible and accessible on all sizes
- n8n chatbot window adjusts size (as configured in code)
- ElevenLabs widget remains functional

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Scripts not loading

**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify no ad blockers are blocking external scripts
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Try hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Issue: n8n chatbot not responding

**Solution:**
- Verify the webhook URL is correct: `https://n8n.srv982383.hstgr.cloud/webhook/27dc8f3f-135a-46ed-9a6f-149c8b9eb778/chat`
- Test the webhook URL directly in a browser or Postman
- Check if your n8n workflow is active and running

### Issue: ElevenLabs chatbot not appearing

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for script loading errors
- Verify the script URL is accessible: `https://unpkg.com/@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed`
- Ensure the agent ID is correct: `agent_7601k8adqn77ec9bhk69g39k19fp`
- Check if custom element is registered:
  ```javascript
  customElements.get('elevenlabs-convai')
  ```

### Issue: Microphone permissions denied

**Solution:**
- Grant microphone permissions in browser settings
- Check site permissions in browser address bar
- Ensure you're testing on `localhost` (not file:// protocol)

### Issue: CORS errors

**Solution:**
- Both chatbots use external CDNs, so CORS should not be an issue
- If you see CORS errors, check your network/firewall settings
- Verify you're accessing via `http://localhost:8083` not `file://`
